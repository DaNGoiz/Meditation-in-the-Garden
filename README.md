# Meditation in the Backyard

## Descriptions

The artwork we create in Project II is called “Meditation in the Backyard”. In this virtual world, players will immerse themselves in a peaceful moment. They can search for interactive objects in a realistic environment, stimulating their senses of realism to the scene. The sounds of chirping sheep and fluttering butterflies create a serene atmosphere, allowing players to experience the ease and joy of nature. This virtual artwork can evoke players' emotions and imagination. It is a spiritual journey that will bring you inspiration and unparalleled feelings.
